// we should use json server to fetch data saved in db.json to generate the endpoints

//json server needed to be running in the background otherwise data fetch cant be achieved
//npm install -g json-server

//To producde the endpoints
//json-server -w ./data/db.json

//one of the drawback of using a component library like chakra UI =>
//  is that our website start to feel very same and generic coz they all use the same pre-styled components and all those components use whats known a default theme inside chakra 
// and that default theme dectates the color palette available to us the font sizes the font faces the breakpoints spacing border radius etc
